# 16BitShiftMatrixMIDI
To handle 16 bits, you would need 2 parallel-to-serial shift registers cascaded together. Each shift register provides 8 output bits, so by cascading two of them, you get a total of 16 output bits. This setup perfectly matches your requirement for a 4x4 button matrix, where you have 16 buttons.
